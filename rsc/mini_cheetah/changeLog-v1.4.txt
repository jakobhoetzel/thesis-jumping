===================Current issues===================

========================v1.4========================
1) Modify origins of joints and links
	(1) small modification of the size
	(2) hind abduction: rotating axis is reversed by changing pitch angle by pi
2) New mesh files

========================v1.3========================
1) ***Modify body mass/inertia***
	(1) mass: 3.3 --> 5.868
	(2) inertia: {ixx, iyy, izz} = {0.011253, 0.362030, 0.042673} --> {0.02000988, 0.075876593, 0.085403948}
2) ***Add maximum torque***
	(1) abduction, thigh: 18 Nm
	(2) knee: 11.6 Nm
3) Modify thigh's collision box to become smaller
	(1) {0.038 0.03 0.21} --> {0.025 0.025 0.16}

Now, total mass = 10.82kg(including a battery)
cf) the order of magnitude of iyy is reduced by referring to the pybullet3's minicheetah urdf file.

========================v1.2========================
1) ***Modify joint limits***
	(1) corrected degree to radian pi calculation mistakes
2) ***Knee(Shank) Center of Mass***
	(1) URDF: (xyz="0.0 0.0 -0.209")  -->  (xyz="0.0 0.0 -0.061")
3) Change mass and inertia of toe links
	(1) set all 0
4) Add dynamics attributes to abduct/thigh joints
	(1) <actuator>  -->  <dynamics>
	(2) applied to all torso_to_abduct/abduct_to_thigh joints

========================v1.1========================
1) Change collision part(simplification):
	(1) mesh  -->  box/cylinder/sphere
	(2) origin
2) Change joint type
	(1) "continuous" -> "revolute"
3) Add joint limits
	(1) lower/upper/velocity
4) Add toe links
	(1) a toe link to each knee
